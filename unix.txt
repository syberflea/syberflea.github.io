The find Command: Searching for Large Files
The find command in Linux is a powerful utility for seeking out files that meet specific criteria. To hone in on large files, we can employ the find command with size options:

find / -type f -size +100M

This command line incantation will list all files larger than 100 megabytes from the root directory. It's possible to modify the search criteria for a range of sizes or to execute actions on the files that are found, such as removing them with -exec rm {} \; appended to the command.

The du Command: Assessing File and Directory Sizes
While find is excellent for pinpointing files, du dives deeper, allowing us to understand the sizes of directories as well:

du -h --max-depth=1 /var | sort -hr | head -10

This chain of commands will display the sizes of directories within /var, sort them in descending order, and show the top 10. This is incredibly useful for uncovering directories that have grown unexpectedly bulky.

Advanced Methods: ncdu and ls Command Tricks
Beyond the basics lies ncdu, a simple yet robust utility that presents a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface, allowing users to navigate through the directory structure. Once installed via the package manager, you can launch it with ncdu /, and it will analyze the directory sizes interactively.

Additionally, the ls command can be coaxed into listing files by size with:

ls -lShr

alias gs="git status"
alias gd="git diff"
alias gitc="git commit -m"
alias gl="git log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%>'
alias ll="ls -alF"
alias la="ls -A"

alias ..="cd .."
alias ...="cd ../.."
alias ....="cd ../../.."

alias h="history | tail -30"
alias TAR="tar -zcvf" # dest source
alias UNTAR="tar -zxvf" # source

alias update="sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"
alias gh="history|grep"
